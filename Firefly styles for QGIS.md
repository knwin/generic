# Firefly symbology for points, lines and polygons for QGIS.

This style is inspired by John Nelson's styles from the blog post ["Steal This Firefly Style"](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/mapping/mapping/steal-this-firefly-style-please).

There are 20 color variations. You still can choose different color if needed. It could also be use with random color and color ramps in Categorical and Graduated methods.
